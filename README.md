**SeqGraph for Bioinformatics Applications**

- Programmed in Python, this program generates an overlap graph or de Bruijn graph by applying prefix-suffix matching to the given FASTA file.

- Example of creating an overlap graph: $ python SeqGraph.py testOData.fa -O 

- Example of creating a de Bruijn graph: $ python SeqGraph.py testDBData.fa -D
