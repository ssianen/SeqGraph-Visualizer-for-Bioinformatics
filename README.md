# SeqGraph for Bioinformatics 

Programmed in Python, this program generates an overlap graph or de Bruijn graph by applying prefix-suffix matching to the given FASTA file.

Create an overlap graph
```
$ python SeqGraph.py testOData.fa -O
```

Create a de Bruijn graph
```
$ python SeqGraph.py testDBData.fa -D
```
